Test Plan for Fixed Restraints Implementation

I've made the following fixes to the restraints implementation:

1. Fixed coordinate handling in distance_restraint_force, angle_restraint_force, and dihedral_restraint_force:
   - Added code to check and reshape coordinates if they're not in the correct format
   - Added safety checks to avoid division by zero in vector normalization
   - Added better debugging output to identify issues

2. Fixed coordinate access in integrate.py:
   - Updated both the PIMD and classical MD update_forces functions 
   - Fixed how coordinates are passed to the restraints functions
   - Ensured proper coordinate dimensionality is maintained

3. Enhanced colvar functions to handle coordinate reshaping correctly:
   - Added an ensure_proper_coordinates helper function
   - Made all colvar functions use this helper
   - Added safety checks to avoid numerical issues

To test the implementation, please:

1. Make sure you've installed the updated code:
   cd /Users/afrank/Downloads/FeNNol-main
   pip install -e .

2. Use the input_fixed_test.fnl file I created in the FeNNol-main directory:
   cd /Users/afrank/Downloads/FeNNol-main
   python -m fennol.md.dynamic input_fixed_test.fnl

3. Look for these key indicators in the output:
   - The coordinates for atoms 10 and 100 should be different
   - The calculated distance should be non-zero
   - The restraint energy should change during the simulation
   - The restraint forces should be non-zero

4. Try different atom pairs or force constants:
   - Edit input_fixed_test.fnl to try different atom indices
   - Increase force_constant to see stronger restraint effects
   - Try flat_bottom style with a tolerance parameter

Additional notes:
- The debugging output should clearly show what's happening with each restraint
- If there are still issues, the detailed output will help identify them
- You may need to adjust atom indices depending on your specific system

Let me know the results and if any further adjustments are needed!
